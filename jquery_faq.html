    <h1 id="main-header">10 "Frequently" Asked Questions About National Parks!</h1>
    <dl>
            <dt>Is Yellowstone National Park bigger than Rhode Island and Delaware Combined?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Well yes. Though neither of these states can boast their size. If a national park wants to brag, it should measure itself against Texas or Alaska... then i'll be impressed.</dd>

            <dt>Is it possible to enter the park after entrance stations close?</dt>
            <dd  class="invisible">If you arrive after hours and entrance stations or visitor centers are closed, you may proceed into the park. Please pay your entry fee at a convenient time at an entrance station.</dd>

            <dt>When will I be able to have an off day to visit Big Bend National Park</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">It depends on your circumstance. This is a FAQ board for parks, not a travel site.</dd>

            <dd class="invisible">Well the picture makes it look like 0, but the official answer is "Idk."</dd>


            <dt>Does Glacier National Park have a glacier?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">I'm pretty sure the name is derived from the fact that the glacier formed the park, not that there's a glacier... JUST KIDDING! it has almost two dozen active glaciers.</dd>

            <dt>How many acres are in Denali National Park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Google says 6 million.</dd>

            <dt>Why is it called Death Valley National Park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Death Valley was given its forbidding name by a group of pioneers lost here in the winter of 1849-1850.</dd>

            <dt>Why is this question about Death Valley National Park again?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Because I'm getting tired of adding dts and dds.</dd>

            <dt>What makes a National Park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">In an Act of August 18, 1970, the National Park System was defined in law as any area of land or water now and hereafter administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the National Park Service for park, monument, historic, parkway, recreational, or other purposes.</dd>
